C
    Server:

    bash

python3 p1_server.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT> <FAST_RECOVERY_BOOL>

Client:

bash

    python3 p1_client.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT>

Testing:

    Ensure both the server and client are running on the correct IP addresses and ports.
    Test the file transfer and verify that the received_file.txt matches the original file.

Additional Notes:

    Since you're not implementing congestion control in this part of the assignment, you can focus on ensuring reliability and correctness in packet handling.
    Pay attention to timeout intervals and retransmission logic to handle packet loss scenarios effectively.
