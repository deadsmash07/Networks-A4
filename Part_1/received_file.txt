Above is my friends code for the client side. Below I am providing you with further context of the the problem so that you can better create the client side. 

Goal: In this assignment, you will implement a simple file transfer protocol using UDP sock- ets. Since UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is unreliable and does not provide congestion control, you will design and implement mechanisms to ensure reliability and congestion control at the application layer.
Overview: You will be tasked with creating a client-server application where the client down- loads a pre-specified file from the server using UDP. The client and server should implement:
1
• Reliability: Ensure that all packets are delivered to the client in the correct order and without loss.
• Congestion Control: Implement a congestion control algorithm to prevent overwhelming the network. You will implement TCP Reno and CUBIC (if you attempt the bonus part).
General Instructions
• • •
•
•
Any instance of cheating will receive strict penalty. You are allowed to do this assignment in a pair.
You will need Mininet and Ryu controller for the analysis part in this section. You can re-use the installation that you used in Assignment 3.
You should submit a single zipped folder containing all the code as well as the report. Name it <entry no 1> <entry no 2>.zip, i.e., the names of your and your partner’s entry number. Please note: Only one submission per group is required.
Piazza protocols: We will follow the following Piazza protocols like last time:
– Piazza protocol 0: You are encouraged to ask questions on Piazza.
– Piazza protocol 1: Each new question should be asked in a separate thread with a clear subject line. Using a descriptive subject line is helpful to everyone.
– Piazza protocol 2: Please ask questions in advance. Not all questions that are asked within 2 days of the deadline may be answered. No questions will be answered after the deadline.
Part 1: Reliability (40%)
Since UDP does not guarantee reliability, you will implement the following mechanisms to ensure reliable data transmission:
• Acknowledgments (ACKs): The client uses ACKs to intimate the server about the successful delivery of a message. You should implement cumulative ACKs. Feel free to use delayed ACKs if you find that improves the efficiency.
• Retransmissions: If the server does not receive an ACK within a specified timeout period or detects 3 duplicate ACKs, it should retransmit the packet.
1
• Fast Recovery: The server should implement a fast recovery mechanism that initiates retransmission upon receiving 3 duplicate ACKs.
• Packet Numbering: Each packet sent by the server should include a sequence number. The client will use these sequence numbers to reconstruct the file in the correct order.
• Timeout Mechanism: The server should implement a timeout mechanism to trigger re- transmissions of unacknowledged packets. The timeout value should be estimated using the method discussed in class. If you are using another method, please mention that in your report.
You can implement reliability only for server-client communication. For the initial client-server communication, you can simply keep re-trying until the request for file download is successfully delivered. You can assume the server is handling only one client.
1.1 Packet Format
While TCP uses a 32-bit integer to represent packet sequence number, in this assignment, we will assume that sequence numbers can be arbitrarily large. For us, the first byte will start with a sequence number of zero and the rest increment from there. Thus, a data packet contain the following fields: sequence number of the first byte, number of data bytes, the data. Moreover, we will serialize information using json to keep debugging and serializing/deserializing simple. You are free to use your own identifiers for these fields.
Acknowledgement packets simply contain the next expected sequence number, indicating the sender that all bytes before this sequence number have been received.
1.2 Analysis
You should empirically measure the performance improvements due to fast re-transmissions by conducting the following analysis:
• Setup: Run a simple two-node topology in Mininet, provided along with this assignment. It consists of two hosts (h1 and h2) connected via a switch (s1). Use a Ryu controller application running a simple learning switch to set up the forwarding tables on the switch. Use your program that implements reliability but no congestion control to transfer a file between the client and server. Use a a fixed rate of 50 Mbps to send the packets.
• Experiments: Conduct two sets of experiments: one measuring the improvement due to fast recovery under varying loss conditions, and another measuring the improvement with varying delay. For the loss experiments, set a fixed delay of 20 ms on the h1-s1. link and vary the loss rate from 0% to 5%, in increments of 0.5%. For the delay experiments, set a fixed packet loss rate of 1% on the h1-s1 link and vary the delay from 0 to 200 ms, in increments of 20 ms. In both cases, set the loss and delay for the h2-s2 link to 0. Data Collection: For each experiment, log the time taken to download the file. Repeat each experiment 5 times to account for noise.
• Plotting Results: For the loss experiments, create a line plot comparing the file trans- mission time with and without fast recovery as the loss varies. Similarly, generate a plot for the delay experiments, comparing the transmission times as delay changes. Explain the observed trends in the results in the report.
1.3 What to submit
Submit the client file and server file, naming them p1 client.py and p1 server.py. We should be able to run the code as follows:
Running server: python3 p1_server.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT> <FAST_RECOVERY_BOOL>
Running client: python3 p1_client.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT>
2

Here, SERVER IP and SERVER PORT represent the IP address and port that the server is listening on. The FAST RECOVERY BOOL indicates whether fast recovery is enabled, with a value of 1 meaning it is on and 0 meaning it is off.
In addition, add the plot and your explanation in the report.



1. Give me the correct client code .
2. If there are any issues with the server code explain them. I do not need to implement congestion control right now in the assignment.

To create a client that works with your provided server code (p1_server.py), we need to understand how the server communicates and structure the client accordingly. Below is the client code (p1_client.py) tailored to work with your server implementation.

Explanation of the Client Code:

    Socket Initialization: The client creates a UDP socket and sets a timeout for socket operations.

    Initiate File Transfer: Sends a "START" message to the server to initiate the file transfer.

    Packet Reception Loop: The client enters a loop where it waits to receive packets from the server.

        Packet Handling:
            If the packet is "END", it sets file_done to True and breaks the loop.
            Else, it decodes the packet from JSON and extracts seq_num, data_len, and data.

        In-Order Packet:
            If seq_num matches expected_seq_num, it writes the data to the file and updates expected_seq_num.
            Checks for any buffered packets that can now be written to the file.
            Sends an ACK with the ack_num set to the seq_num of the received packet.

        Out-of-Order Packet:
            Buffers the packet data in a dictionary keyed by seq_num.
            Sends an ACK for the last in-order packet received.

        Duplicate Packet:
            Resends an ACK for the seq_num of the duplicate packet.

    Timeout Handling: If a socket timeout occurs, the client simply continues to wait for packets.

    Completion Message: After the file is successfully received, it prints a confirmation message.

Issues with the Server Code:

    Client Address Handling:
        The server code expects the client_address as an argument when calling server.run("file_to_send.txt", client_address).
        In your current implementation, client_address is set to (args.server_ip, args.server_port), which refers to the server's own IP and port.
        Solution: Modify the server to listen for a "START" message from the client and extract the client_address from the received packet.

    python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("server_ip", help="Server IP address")
    parser.add_argument("server_port", type=int, help="Server port")
    parser.add_argument("enable_fast_recovery", type=int, choices=[0, 1], help="Enable fast recovery (1=yes, 0=no)")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    server = ReliableServer(args.server_ip, args.server_port, args.enable_fast_recovery)
    print("Server is ready to receive.")

    # Wait for a client connection
    while True:
        data, client_address = server.server_socket.recvfrom(1024)
        if data == b"START":
            print(f"Received START request from {client_address}")
            server.run("file_to_send.txt", client_address)
            break  # Exit the loop after handling one client

Sequence Number and ACK Handling:

    The server increments seq_num by MSS, assuming each packet is of size MSS.
    According to your assignment, "ACK_NUM is the Seq num of packet received by the client. Not the next!"
    Issue: This deviates from standard TCP behavior where the ACK number is the next expected sequence number.
    Solution: Adjust the handle_ack method in the server to correctly update window_base and handle cumulative ACKs.

python

def handle_ack(self, ack_num, client_address):
    if ack_num > self.last_ack:
        print(f"Received new ACK for seq_num {ack_num}")
        self.last_ack = ack_num
        self.dup_ack_count = 0
        self.window_base = ack_num + MSS  # Adjust as per the assignment requirements

        # Update ACK time for each acknowledged packet in the map
        for seq in list(self.packet_map):
            if seq <= ack_num:
                self.packet_map[seq]["ack_time"] = time.time()
                del self.packet_map[seq]  # Remove acknowledged packets
    else:
        # Handle duplicate ACKs
        self.dup_ack_count += 1
        print(f"Received duplicate ACK for seq_num {ack_num}")
        if self.enable_fast_recovery and self.dup_ack_count >= DUP_ACK_THRESHOLD:
            print("Fast recovery triggered")
            self.resend_packet(ack_num + MSS, client_address)

File Reading Logic:

    In the run method, when chunk = file.read(MSS) returns an empty byte string, it sets self.file_done = True but continues the loop.
    Issue: This may cause unnecessary iterations.
    Solution: Add a break statement after setting self.file_done = True.

python

    if not chunk:
        self.file_done = True
        break  # Exit the loop if no more data

    Window Base Update:
        The window base should be updated based on the cumulative ACK received.
        Ensure that self.window_base is set to the correct value according to the ACK mechanism specified in your assignment.

    Data Length Consistency:
        When incrementing expected_seq_num and handling sequence numbers, ensure that you are consistent with the data lengths being added.

Note: The server and client must agree on the protocol specifics, especially regarding sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers. Adjust the code to ensure both sides are consistent.

Summary:

    Client (p1_client.py): The provided client code is designed to work with your server code, handling the reception of packets, buffering out-of-order packets, and sending appropriate ACKs.

    Server Adjustments: The server code requires some modifications to correctly handle client connections, sequence numbers, and ACKs as per your assignment specifications.

Running the Code:

    Server:

    bash

python3 p1_server.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT> <FAST_RECOVERY_BOOL>

Client:

bash

    python3 p1_client.py <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT>

Testing:

    Ensure both the server and client are running on the correct IP addresses and ports.
    Test the file transfer and verify that the received_file.txt matches the original file.

Additional Notes:

    Since you're not implementing congestion control in this part of the assignment, you can focus on ensuring reliability and correctness in packet handling.
    Pay attention to timeout intervals and retransmission logic to handle packet loss scenarios effectively.
